  <title>ISO SCHEMATRON 2010</title>
  <desc>ISO Schematron is a language for making assertion about the presence or absense
    of patterns in XML documents. It is typically used for as a schema language, or
    to augment existing schema languages, and to check business rules. It is very
    powerful, yet quite simple: a developer only need know XPath and about five other
    elements. 
    
    This is an open source implementation of ISO Schematron in XSLT. Although ISO does
    not allow reference implementations which might compete with the text of the
    standard, this code has been compiled by Rick Jelliffe, inventor of Schematron
    and editor of the ISO standard; so developers can certainly use it as an 
    unofficial reference implementation for clarification. 
    
    This implementation is based on one by Oliver Becker. API documentation is 
    available separately; try www.schematron.com for this. Funding for this
    stylesheet over the years has come from Topologi Pty. Ltd., Geotempo Ltd.,
    and ASCC, Tapei.
    
    There are two versions of this skeleton: one is tailored for XSLT1 processors
    and the other is tailored for XSLT2 processors. Future versions of the
    XSLT2 skeleton may support more features than that the XSLT 1 skeleton.
