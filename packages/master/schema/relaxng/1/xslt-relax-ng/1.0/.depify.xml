 <title>RelaxNG schemas for XSLT 1 &amp; XSLT 2</title>
  <desc>
    This project provides RELAX NG grammars for XSLT stylesheets. Because stylesheets are required to have a version number, it's straightforward for a RELAX NG validator to choose between the xslt10.rnc and xslt20.rnc grammars.
    As work on XSLT 3.0 stabilizes, I plan to include support for that as well.
    Having a RELAX NG grammar makes syntax directed editing of XSLT stylesheets much easier in tools like Emacs and oXygen that support RELAX NG.
