  <desc xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <xhtml:p>This project provides RELAX NG grammars for XSLT stylesheets. Because stylesheets are required to have a version number, it's straightforward for a RELAX NG validator to choose between the xslt10.rnc and xslt20.rnc grammars.</xhtml:p>
    <xhtml:p>As work on XSLT 3.0 stabilizes, I plan to include support for that as well.</xhtml:p>
    <xhtml:p>Having a RELAX NG grammar makes syntax directed editing of XSLT stylesheets much easier in tools like Emacs and oXygen that support RELAX NG.</xhtml:p>
