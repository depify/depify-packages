  <desc>The normal task server queue doesn't discriminate between kinds of tasks. CPF processing can for instance flood the queue, and cause front-end request respond slowly. This queue is maintained separately, allows prioritizing, and the cron is designed only to launch tasks when the task server has spare threads. In other words, ideal for background processing.
